                                        Cryptocurrency mining was once dominated
                                        by individuals and their home computers.
                                        To solo mine now requires hardware that
                                        is expensive, loud, consumes a lot of
                                        energy, requires technical knowledge,
                                        and generates a significant amount of
                                        heat. A mining rig alone can cost tens
                                        of thousands of dollars and finding a
                                        suitable hosting facility is time
                                        consuming and costly.
