                                Cryptocurrency mining was once dominated by
                                individuals and their home computers. To solo
                                mine now requires hardware that is expensive,
                                loud, consumes a lot of energy, requires
                                technical knowledge, and generates a significant
                                amount of heat. A mining rig alone can cost tens
                                of thousands of dollars and finding a suitable
                                hosting facility is time consuming and costly.
